## üé® Using GitHub Copilot Safely

### General Guidelines for AI Prompts

#### ‚úÖ Good Prompts:
- "Help me add a new project section using the same Tailwind classes as existing projects"
- "Change the primary color but keep all the existing class names"
- "Add a skills section that matches the current design style"

#### ‚ùå Avoid These Prompts:
- "Rewrite all the HTML" (too broad)
- "Change the entire layout" (might break things)
- "Remove all the classes" (will break styling)

### Safe Prompt Templates

#### Adding Content:
```
"Add a new [section/project/skill] using the same Tailwind CSS classes as the existing ones. Keep the structure similar but change the content to [your specific content]."
```

#### Changing Colors:
```
"Change the color scheme by updating the Tailwind color classes. Keep 'primary' for main actions, 'secondary' for accent colors, and 'accent' for highlights. Use colors: [your preferred colors]"
```

#### Modifying Text:
```
"Update the text content in the [section name] section to reflect my experience as [your role] with skills in [your skills]. Keep all HTML tags and classes the same."
```

### When AI Makes Mistakes:
1. Press `Ctrl+Z` (or `Cmd+Z`) to undo
2. Check that links to Open Build still work
3. Test your site on mobile and desktop
4. Ask AI to "fix the issue but keep it simple"

## üåê Custom Domain Setup (Optional)

### Using GitHub Pages with Custom Domain:
1. Buy a domain from any provider (Namecheap, GoDaddy, etc.)
2. In your repository, create a file called `CNAME`
3. Add your domain name to the file: `yourname.dev`
4. Update your domain's DNS settings to point to GitHub Pages
5. Wait 24-48 hours for DNS to propagate

### DNS Settings:
```
Type: CNAME
Name: www
Value: [your-username].github.io

Type: A
Name: @
Values: 
185.199.108.153
185.199.109.153
185.199.110.153
185.199.111.153
```

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Site Not Loading?
- Check that `index.html` is in the root folder
- Verify GitHub Pages is enabled in repository settings
- Wait a few minutes after making changes

### Styling Looks Broken?
- Don't remove Tailwind CSS classes
- Keep the `<script src="https://cdn.tailwindcss.com"></script>` tag
- Check browser console for errors

### Images Not Showing?
- Make sure image files are in the correct folder
- Use relative paths: `assets/img/photo.jpg`
- Check file names match exactly (case-sensitive)

### Contact Form Not Working?
- Add a service like Formspree or Netlify Forms
- The template includes team@open.build cc by default
- Test with a simple mailto: link first
